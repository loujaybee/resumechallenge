“The Best Jobs in Cloud” is a biweekly newsletter that comes FREE with your purchase of [the Cloud Resume Challenge Book](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/book).

In each issue, I curate awesome cloud job opportunities from around my network, including an inside referral for each job so you can skip the application line.

## What do I mean by “the best”?

• In most cases, I include **a direct contact link to the hiring manager** or someone else inside the company; no more "spray and pray" of cold applications. My referrals know and love the Cloud Resume Challenge; they'll be expecting you.

• I bias for **remote jobs**; even better if they are true, global “work from anywhere” remote jobs without a geographical restriction.

• I bias for jobs that **include a salary range**.

• I bias for jobs where **I personally know people inside the company** and can vouch for the health of the culture and the interesting-ness of the work.

• I sort the list according to required experience, and I try to make sure I have a healthy balance of **junior, mid-level, and senior jobs**.

## Let me be your talent agent.

I've spent years building thousands of connections in the cloud community for one reason: so I can help as many people as possible find awesome jobs.

Whether you're actively looking for a new job or not, you should be reading this newsletter to get an insider's guide to the best job opportunities in cloud.

You can sign up to the newsletter alone for $5/month - but again, it comes free with your [book purchase](https://forrestbrazeal.gumroad.com/l/cloud-resume-challenge-book/web)!
