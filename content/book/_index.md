# A proven way to advance your cloud career.

> **"This challenge was a HUGE hit with prospective employers."** <br> -*Tejas B, from help desk to DevOps engineer*

Since April 2020, the Cloud Resume Challenge has helped hundreds of people

• skill up on cloud,

• improve their career prospects,

• and even land cloud jobs from totally non-tech fields like plumbing and HR.

Now, I've packed the top challenge tips, strategies, and resources into one book, so you too can build skills, make connections, and get a cloud job FAST.
