# Hall of Fame

Here we celebrate the stories of those who crush the Cloud Resume Challenge. Many of these folks had no previous IT experience. All of them are now certified cloud practitioners.

  ### Romulo Brandino Silva (hired June 2020): 
I got an offer from Microsoft in Las Colinas, TX. I‚Äôll be an Azure Support Engineer in Networking.

The challenge helped me to answer a lot of questions during the tech interview. I told them about how I troubleshooted the DNS issues that I had, how I configured my cloud architecture, everything helped me got this job.

Of course my knowledge of networking, TCP/IP and the 2 AWS certifications (SAA and Developer A) helped also, but doing the project you suggested helped me with real life problems.

  ### Will Boland (challenge completed June 2020): 

Overall, the Cloud Resume Challenge was a fun, engaging project with "challenge" being the operative word. I learned a lot about cloud services, infrastructure-as-code, serverless applications, CI/CD, and some programming skills. I also learned a lot about myself, namely that a beginner's mindset is powerful and that I'm excited to keep going. 

Here's my [resume](https://www.williamsboland.com/) and a [blog](https://dev.to/wboland33/my-experience-with-the-cloud-resume-challenge-1ade) about my work.

  ### Mohamed Muhannad (challenge completed June 2020): 

Coming from an IT infrastructure background for the most part of my career, completing this challenge has been an eye-opener. I believe it‚Äôs important to adapt to new concepts for working with the cloud and be ready for what the future might bring. I think this is a turning point for my career and will be working on finding a role more focused on cloud engineering.

Here's my [resume](https://muhannad.io/).

I also wrote a [series of blogs](https://muhannad0.github.io/post/the-cloud-resume-challenge/) about my experience as I worked through the challenge.

  ### Jeremy Swingle (challenge completed June 2020): 

Overall, I appreciated this challenge. It provided a framework for me to not only learn some new things, but also put together a coherent project using things I had already messed around with. Perhaps most importantly, though, I gained more confidence! There's nothing like the satisfaction of seeing multiple parts of a project "click" together and work just like I wanted it to. This was an exciting opportunity for both my career development and my personal progress.

Here's my [resume](https://www.j-swingle.com/), and a [blog](https://dev.to/jswingle/taking-the-cloudresumechallenge-3lnf) with my advice for future challengers.

  ### Darius Jennings (challenge completed June 2020): 

  I had been looking for some cloud projects that I could add to my resume and I came across this challenge by to create an online resume using AWS and some coding. After reading the instructions, I felt like I was up for the challenge! It took me a few days and I have completed the challenge.

Here's my [resume](https://lnkd.in/gRv7Z4z).

Here's my [blog post](https://lnkd.in/gGmtAtQ) about my experience.

  ### Cha'Diamond Moody (challenge completed May 2020): 

 What an experience! This was a fun project and I've acquired skills that I will continue to develop. I highly recommend this challenge to anyone who is learning to code or learning cloud development. 

Here's my [resume](https://chadiamond.io/resume.html) and [blog](https://chadiamond.io/blog.html) about my experiences. P.S. -- I am happy to share my study guide if anyone is interested.

  ### Jerry Mullis (challenge completed May 2020): 

A friend recommended that I should try this challenge for experience. I completed the Cloud Resume challenge and really enjoyed it. Learned a lot about serverless functions, lambda, API gateway and DynamoDB. Did a quick write-up as well to log my findings.
