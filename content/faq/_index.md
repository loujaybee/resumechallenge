# Who can complete the Cloud Resume Challenge?

Short answer: anybody! It's a fun way to level up your cloud skills, even if you're already a professional.

However, the less prior experience you have, the bigger deal I will make out of you.

For example, somebody who completes the Cloud Resume Challenge with no prior IT experience or related degree is going to get personal shoutouts on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestbrazeal/), personalized code reviews, direct intros to hiring managers, etc.

## Who are you and why are you doing this?

My name is [Forrest Brazeal](https://forrestbrazeal.com). I'm an AWS Serverless Hero and I've been building in the cloud for many years. I would not be at this point in my career without the generous help of many people.

I work at [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru), a cloud education company, but this is a personal attempt to give back to the community. 

## Does completing the Cloud Resume Challenge guarantee I will get a job in the cloud?

No. But I will get your name and resume in front of as many people as I can to help.

Now, fair warning: you will have to open a large number of browser tabs to figure out the challenge. It will take you quite a few long evenings at the kitchen table. You might reasonably conclude that none of it is worth the dubious reward of having a random industry professional share your resume with a few thousand people.

But if you give this project a try and realize that you hate it, or you're just not interested, you'll have learned a valuable lesson about whether or not you really want a career in the cloud -- because **these are the types of problems that real cloud engineers and developers really work on.**

And I believe that if you can, in good faith, complete the Cloud Resume Challenge, **you will already have more useful skills than a lot of people who graduate from university computer science programs.** Specifically: you will understand something about full-stack software development, version control, infrastructure as code, automation, continuous integration and delivery, cloud services and "serverless", application security, and networking. And you'll have learned by doing, because I didn't give you enough instructions to figure any of this out without going down some late-night rabbit holes. Most importantly, you will have demonstrated the number-one skill in a cloud engineer's toolbox: the ability to learn fast and google well.

Those are skills you can take to a job interview. And I'll do my best to help you get one.

Good luck!

## Can I complete the challenge using [different technology X]?
Yes! Feel free to use different cloud providers, DevOps tools, etc -- as long as you have met the end objective described in each step.

## Can I share my solutions online?

You are encouraged to share your general observations and personal approach to solving the challenge when you write your wrap-up blog post. However, I ask that you please don't share your Python and Javascript code. Let's keep the challenge properly challenging for others!

## Are there other resources I can use to get some professional experience on my resume?

Check out Anthony James' [Kysen Journal](http://kysenjournal.com/) -- he is paying qualified applicants to build their resume with microprojects. Completing the Cloud Resume Challenge is one way to meet his training prerequisites.

## What is the cloud, anyway?

Hey, I wrote a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Read-Aloud-Cloud-Innocents-Inside/dp/1119677629/) about that!
